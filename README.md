# trick-or-treat-bot
A little halloween AIY voice bot that dispenses candy when saying the key words.

This project uses google AIY voice kit and a servo to manage and dispense candy when a user (a child dressed in costume to celebrate Halloween) says the keywords: 'Trick or treat!'

The voice kit listens for these keywords and triggers the servo bot to move, which, connected to a handmade dispenser holding candy, dispenses the candy!

Happy Halloween!
